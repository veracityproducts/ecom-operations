# Shipping Routing Strategy - Phased Approach

## Phase 1: MVP with Standard Products (Week 1)

### Target Products
Start with your most standardized, high-volume products:
1. **Code Breakers Book Set** - Always ships from CA, predictable weight
2. **Sound Cards** - Small, lightweight, simple packaging
3. **Single Workbooks** - Standard size/weight

### Simple Routing Rules
```python
PHASE_1_RULES = {
    "CB-BOOK-SET": {
        "from_warehouse": "CA",
        "package_type": "medium_box",
        "weight": 3.5,  # lbs
        "carriers": {
            "zones_1_5": {"preferred": "UPS_GROUND", "max_cost": 8.00},
            "zones_6_8": {"preferred": "USPS_PRIORITY", "max_cost": 12.00}
        }
    },
    "SOUND-CARDS-44": {
        "from_warehouse": "CA", 
        "package_type": "padded_envelope",
        "weight": 1.2,
        "carriers": {
            "all_zones": {"preferred": "USPS_FIRST_CLASS", "max_cost": 5.00}
        }
    }
}
```

## Phase 2: Data Collection (Weeks 2-4)

### Track Every Order
- Actual shipping costs vs estimates
- Delivery times by carrier/zone
- Exception cases (damages, delays)
- Customer location patterns

### Identify Patterns
- Which products often ship together?
- What zones drive most volume?
- When does it make sense to ship from PA?
- Which carriers perform best by region?

## Phase 3: Smart Routing (Month 2)

### Dynamic Rules Based on Data
```python
SMART_ROUTING = {
    "decision_factors": [
        "customer_location_zone",
        "product_availability",
        "carrier_performance_history",
        "current_shipping_rates",
        "delivery_time_requirements"
    ],
    "rules": {
        "multi_item_orders": "optimize_single_shipment_vs_split",
        "east_coast": "prefer_pa_warehouse_if_available",
        "expedited": "use_fedex_2day_under_$20"
    }
}
```

## Phase 4: Full Integration (Month 3)

### Complete System
- Real-time inventory by location
- Automated rebalancing suggestions
- Cost optimization algorithms
- Seasonal pattern recognition

## Implementation Approach

### Start Simple (This Week):
1. Add basic routing to existing code:
```python
def get_shipping_rules(order):
    # Check primary SKU
    primary_sku = order.line_items[0].get('sku')
    
    # Default rules
    rules = {
        "from_address": settings.warehouse_ca_address,
        "max_cost": 10.00,
        "preferred_carrier": None
    }
    
    # Override for specific products
    if primary_sku == "CB-BOOK-SET":
        rules["preferred_carrier"] = "ups"
        rules["max_cost"] = 8.00
    elif primary_sku == "SOUND-CARDS-44":
        rules["preferred_carrier"] = "usps"
        rules["max_cost"] = 5.00
        
    return rules
```

2. Test with real orders
3. Log everything for analysis
4. Iterate based on actual results

### Why This Approach Works:
- **Get automation running NOW** (revenue impact)
- **Learn from real data** (not assumptions)
- **Build only what you need** (avoid over-engineering)
- **Maintain flexibility** (easy to add rules)

### Next Steps:
1. Pick your standard product for testing
2. Run end-to-end test with that product
3. Deploy for just that SKU
4. Expand gradually with lessons learned

Would you like to proceed with testing your most standard product first?
