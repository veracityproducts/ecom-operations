# Grooved Learning Fulfillment System Specification

## üéØ Project Overview

**Objective**: Design and implement a comprehensive order fulfillment system that enables automated shipping label generation WITH packing slips across multiple inventory locations, with the foundation for future customer service automation.

**Current Pain Point**: ShipStation API cannot generate shipping labels with packing slips programmatically, making the system "borderline useless" for automated fulfillment operations.

**Platform**: Shopify Plus
**Business Model**: Educational product manufacturer and retailer
**Target Market**: Parents, teachers, homeschoolers (ages 3-12 focus)

### Product Portfolio (5 Core Lines)

1. **Code Breakers Books Set** - K-6 reading curriculum with spy theme
2. **Code Breakers Sound Cards** - Comprehensive phonics system (44 sounds)
3. **Cursive Reusable Workbooks** - Upper elementary/middle school handwriting
4. **English Handwriting Workbooks** - Ages 3-7 foundational writing skills
5. **Spanish Handwriting Workbooks** - Ages 3-7 bilingual writing development

## üè≠ Current Infrastructure

### Sales Channels
- **Primary**: groovedlearning.com (Shopify Plus)
- **Secondary**: Amazon marketplace
- **Emerging**: TikTok Shop

### Inventory Locations
- **Amazon Warehouses**: FBA inventory
- **California Warehouse**: Primary fulfillment center
