- **project-coordination-specialist** → Success metrics validation
- **Documentation** → Complete system documentation and handoff

## Coordination Protocols

### Daily Coordination (Async)
- **Status Updates**: Brief progress reports via project-coordination-specialist
- **Blocker Identification**: Immediate escalation of dependencies or issues
- **Priority Adjustments**: Daily priority stack ranking based on progress

### Weekly Coordination (Synchronous)
- **Progress Review**: Comprehensive review with all specialists
- **Integration Planning**: Coordinate cross-specialist dependencies
- **Quality Gate Preparation**: Prepare for upcoming validation points

### Milestone Reviews (Formal Validation)
- **Deliverable Demonstration**: Full system demonstration to stakeholders
- **Quality Gate Assessment**: Formal validation by quality-assurance-specialist
- **Phase Transition**: Approval to proceed to next phase
