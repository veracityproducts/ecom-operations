**Critical Finding**: ShipStation's inability to programmatically generate packing slips is solvable through alternative platforms and architectural patterns.

**Top Alternatives Identified**:
1. **Shippo** (Recommended): $0.05/label with full API packing slip support
   - RESTful API with `/orders/<order-id>/packingslip/` endpoint
   - PDF, PNG, ZPL formats for various printers
   - Combo packing slips (label + slip on 8.5x11")
   - No monthly fees, pay-per-label model ideal for scaling

2. **Ordoro**: Comprehensive features with $149/month unlimited plan
   - Custom packing slips per sales channel
   - Batch printing capabilities
   - Strong inventory management integration

3. **Easyship**: Best for future international expansion
   - 250+ carrier integrations globally
   - Free tier up to 50 shipments/month

**Multi-Warehouse Routing Optimization**:
- **Zone Skipping Strategy**: 20% cost reduction potential through consolidated shipments
- **Geographic Optimization**: Nearest location algorithm with cost-distance matrix
- **Real-time Sync**: Shopify Plus native multi-location support with priority fulfillment

### Educational Market Requirements
