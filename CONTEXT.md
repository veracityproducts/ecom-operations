# Grooved Learning - Current Project Context

## üö® Active Challenge: Fulfillment System Overhaul

**Status**: Research & Planning Phase
**Priority**: Critical - Core Business Operations

### Current Pain Point
ShipStation API cannot generate shipping labels WITH packing slips programmatically, making automated fulfillment impossible. This forces manual intervention for every order, limiting scalability.

### Business Impact
- **Manual Labor**: 100% of orders require human intervention for packing slips
- **Error Risk**: Higher chance of shipping wrong items
- **Scalability Block**: Cannot handle seasonal volume spikes efficiently
- **Cost Impact**: Higher labor costs, suboptimal shipping decisions

## üè≠ Current Infrastructure Status

### Sales Channels (Active)
- **groovedlearning.com**: Shopify Plus (primary)
- **Amazon**: FBA + Seller Central
- **TikTok Shop**: Substantial channel

### Inventory Locations
- **California Warehouse**: Primary fulfillment center
- **Pennsylvania Warehouse**: East coast distribution
- **Amazon FBA**: Multi-location inventory
- **TikTok Warehouses**: Platform-specific stock

### Current Tech Stack
```
E-commerce: Shopify Plus
Order Management: ShipStation (problematic)
Shipping: Multiple carriers via ShipStation
Inventory: Manual tracking across locations
Customer Service: Manual processes
```

## üìä Business Metrics & Context

### Volume Patterns
- **Average Daily Orders**: 50-150 orders
- **Peak Season**: 300-500 orders/day (back-to-school)
- **Product Mix**: 5 core educational product lines
- **Customer Base**: Parents, teachers, homeschoolers

### Operational Challenges
1. **Inventory Routing**: Which warehouse should fulfill each order?
2. **Shipping Optimization**: Balancing cost vs. delivery speed
3. **Quality Control**: Ensuring correct items in packages
4. **Customer Communication**: Limited automation for updates
5. **Returns Processing**: Manual, time-intensive workflow

## üéØ Current Project Focus: Fulfillment Automation

### Immediate Goals
- [ ] Research ShipStation alternatives
- [ ] Evaluate API capabilities for label + packing slip generation
- [ ] Design multi-location inventory routing logic
- [ ] Plan Shopify Plus integration strategy
- [ ] Create implementation roadmap

### Success Criteria
- **Primary**: Automated label + packing slip generation
- **Secondary**: 75% reduction in manual fulfillment tasks
- **Tertiary**: Foundation for customer service automation

## üõ† Technical Considerations

### Requirements
- **Language**: Python (UV-based projects preferred)
- **Integration**: Shopify Plus + carrier APIs
- **Performance**: <30 seconds label generation, 99.5% uptime
- **Scalability**: Handle 3x current volume
- **Storage**: Google Drive integration for labels/documents

### Architecture Preferences
- **Modular Design**: Independent, testable components
- **API-First**: Everything accessible via API
- **Cloud-Based**: Reliable, scalable infrastructure
- **Well-Documented**: Maintainable long-term

## üìÖ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core System (Priority)
